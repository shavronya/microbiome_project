# microbiome
The aim of this project is to develop a microbiome database oriented on the changes of abundance of microbes over time, across populations and in context of urbanization for future reference & research.

To reach the goal, the following tasks were set:
* mine & catalogue the abundance, depletion & loss of microbes;
* survey the impact of microbial diversity on health & disease.

The project is an intership task at A*STAR (Bioinformatics Intitute).
